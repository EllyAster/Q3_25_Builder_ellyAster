# Function Maps

| Function | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Tenant Account Creation** | An on-chain account that stores Tenant Information |
| **Tenant Wallet Funding** | Fiat on-ramp integration to allow payment from fiat to crypto from tenant |
| **Set A Payment Schedule** | Set the frequency at which payments occur and amount |

# On-Chain Requirements 

Below listed are the on-chain requirements. What will not be included are the off-chain requirements such as user interfaces (displays users see on their devices).

#### Tenant Account Creation

- Would need to create an on chain Account to hold Tenant Information  
- It will store balance information, as well as balance owed

#### Tenant Wallet Funding

- Would integrate a on-ramp program “jup pay” “Venomo” in order for a user to add funds to their wallet/account  
- This will be a wrapper for one of the existing integrations 

#### Payment Scheduling

- On chain program that uses an escrow transfer funds from tenant to landlord   
- Will contain  
 


#### Manage Payment

- Part of the Payment Program’s that sets flags to pause/start/stop payment transfers   
- Transfers will check this flag (“state”) set by the manage Program 

#### Support & Dispute Management

- Refund tenant or landlord based off flagged issues  
- Would have signing privileges over the Payment PDA  
- Able to change the state of the Payment Program (active, pause, canceled, reversed)

# Process Appendix

Note: I often write my thoughts out as “comments” within google docs. As such, all the comments I wrote will not be visible within this document. My brain thinking can often be a mess and randomly jump from one section to a previous. As such it won’t make sense to the reader. Cheers\~ 

P.S. Due to a time constraint I did not format this below section anywhere near as cleanly as I did for Assignment 1\. I will be modifying this document outside this PDF as well.

My project's value proposition is \[This platform is a blockchain-powered rent streaming protocol designed specifically for real estate landlords. It solves the operational pain of rent collection by automating payments, reducing delays, and providing instant access to global capital. By bringing rent flows on-chain, landlords gain real-time visibility, programmable disbursements, and composability with DeFi tools — transforming static rental income into dynamic, liquid yield. The product targets real estate owners frustrated with inefficient rent infrastructure and cash flow bottlenecks, starting with small-to-mid scale landlords in developed and emerging markets. Product-market fit is anchored in the growing appetite for tokenized real-world assets, paired with landlords’ demand for financial tools that offer better speed, transparency, and optionality than legacy systems.

\]. Here is a brainstormed list of all potential user types: \[Direct Users

\]. Based on the value proposition, which 2-5 of these user types are the most critical to focus on for an initial Proof-of-Concept? For each user you recommend, provide a brief rationale explaining why they are essential for proving the project's core value

Output

For your rent streaming protocol, the **Proof-of-Concept (PoC)** should validate your **core value proposition**: that *on-chain rent collection solves real-world pain for landlords and enables programmable, liquid, and transparent income streams*. To prove this, you need to prioritize users who:

1. Experience the problem directly,

2. Interact with the payment rails, and

3. Enable real capital flow through the system.

### **🎯 Top 3–4 Most Critical User Types for PoC**

---

### **1\. Landlords (Direct User)**

**🧩 Why Essential:**  
 They are the **primary value recipient** of the protocol. The PoC must validate whether on-chain rent solves their pain points around delayed payments, cash flow predictability, and capital access.

**🏗 What You Need from Them:**

* Willingness to pilot on-chain rent streaming

* Feedback on UX, stability, and integration with their property management workflows

* Interest in using tokenized income (e.g., accessing liquidity or staking)

---

### **2\. Tenants (Direct User)**

**🧩 Why Essential:**  
 Even if the protocol is landlord-focused, **tenant participation is required** to validate rent payment mechanics, streaming logic, and usability.

**🏗 What You Need from Them:**

* Willingness to pay rent through the protocol (possibly with stablecoins)

* Feedback on onboarding friction, wallet use, and trust issues

* Help demonstrating consistent payment flow for yield generation

---

### **3\. Platform Admin/Operators (Internal User)**

**🧩 Why Essential:**  
 You’ll need an operator or admin layer (could be you/team initially) to manage property whitelisting, verify landlords, and handle compliance-sensitive tasks (e.g., KYC, support, or dispute resolution).

**🏗 What You Need from Them:**

* Define admin-level workflows

* Monitor metrics and ensure protocol performance

* Enforce guardrails (especially in PoC or pilot phase)

---

### **4\. Developers (Internal User)**

**🧩 Why Essential:**  
 The success of a PoC depends on shipping a secure, usable MVP. Your internal devs are key for smart contract reliability, rent streaming accuracy, and integrating payment gateways (crypto or fiat on/off ramps).

**🏗 What You Need from Them:**

* Rapid iteration and testing of rent stream contracts

* Building minimal front-end UX for both landlord and tenant

* Ensuring the system is auditable and extensible

---

### **⚠️ User Types to Defer for Later Phases**

| User Type | Why Not Now |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Investors / LPs / Stakers** | They matter when you're scaling liquidity or building a DeFi layer on top. First, prove rent is flowing. |
| **Platform Owners (3rd parties)** | Useful for scaling as a SaaS or protocol layer. Initially, *you* play this role to validate product-market fit. |

---

## **✅ TL;DR – Focus PoC on:**

| User Type | Role in PoC | Why Critical |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 🏠 **Landlords** | Primary user | Validates core rent streaming value |
| 👥 **Tenants** | Rent payers | Confirms real-world rent flow viability |
| 🛠 **Platform Admins** | Internal ops layer | Ensures protocol runs securely and compliantly |
| 👨‍💻 **Developers** | Builders | Enable rapid prototyping, fixes, and infrastructure validation |

Are the requirements granular enough to map to specific technical components (e.g., database schemas, API endpoints, specific blockchain programs)? What's missing or unclear? Output You're *very close* — your user stories are structured well and clearly align with your refined value proposition. However, if your goal is to move confidently from these stories to technical execution (i.e., writing Solana programs, designing schemas, defining APIs), you’ll need tighter scoping, clearer separation between core MVP logic vs. nice-to-haves, and a few refinements to bridge from user action → system logic. ✅ What’s Working 🎯 Alignment with Value Proposition Your stories effectively reflect: The core pain point: manual, delayed, and opaque rent flows Your unique offering: on-chain rent automation \+ visibility Your audience: landlords and tenants, with platform operators/admins for enforcement 🔗 Mapped to Real Technical Work Most functions can lead directly into: Solana PDAs & Anchor programs (for rent streams) Off-chain support/monitoring tools (for admin activity) Frontend flows (tenant rent approval, landlord dashboards) 🔧 Where It Falls Short / Could Be Sharpened Here are the key issues, what’s missing or vague, and how to tighten for implementation: 🟥 1\. No Explicit State Definitions or Transitions (for Rent Streams) Issue: You mention stream creation, pause, modify, terminate — but not how state transitions work. Fix: Add an explicit Stream Lifecycle with states like: `Draft` → `Initialized` → `Active` → `Paused` → `Completed` / `Terminated` This directly maps to: Program accounts & PDA schema Anchor enums Admin logic for overrides 🟥 2\. Rent Funding & Payment Approval Needs More Precision Issue: "Set up rent funding" and "approve stream" are good UX descriptions, but don’t specify the technical handoff between off-chain and on-chain logic. Fix: Break this into: Fund Tenant Wallet (fiat on-ramp integration OR testnet faucet) Approve USDC Transfer to Stream (using SPL token allowance model) Stream Activation (smart contract triggers time-based disbursement) Also, clarify if you’ll hold funds in escrow, or stream in real-time from tenant → landlord on a drip basis (this affects account design \+ security). 🟥 3\. Lack of Interaction Timing Granularity Issue: You mention "streaming monthly/weekly" but there’s no clear standard for intervals, buffer windows, or grace periods. Fix: Add parameters like: `payment_interval`: weekly | monthly | custom (epoch-based) `start_date`, `grace_period`, `renewal_option` Clock or oracle hook (Solana `Clock sysvar`) for actual rent disbursement triggers 🟥 4\. Missing or Implicit Data Models Issue: The stories don’t specify what data is stored where — making it hard to write Anchor `Accounts`, frontend state, or indexer logic. Fix: Define key data objects: `RentStreamAccount` (landlord, tenant, rent\_amount, token\_mint, interval, status, timestamps) `PropertyAccount` (address, metadata, ownership proof) `UserAccount` (role: landlord/tenant/admin, KYC hash, linked wallet) This will let you go from user story → Anchor struct → schema → GraphQL/indexer. 🟥 5\. Admin & Dispute Management is Underspecified Issue: “Resolve issues” is too vague for implementation. Fix: Define exact actions: `freeze_stream(stream_id) force_close_stream(stream_id) refund_tenant(stream_id, amount) update_dispute_flag(stream_id, reason_code, notes)` Tie this to roles & access control (via Anchor `#[access_control]` or multisig signer list). 🔄 Refined Story → Tech Mapping Example (Landlord) User Action State Program / Component Needed Registers \+ verifies property `N/A` Property PDA \+ KYC off-chain (optional) Creates stream `Initialized` `RentStreamAccount` PDA initialized Tenant approves stream `Active` Stream moves to active after approval \+ funding Monitors rent flow `Active` Solana event log or off-chain indexer UI Pauses/terminates stream `Paused` / `Terminated` Anchor handler → modifies stream state Withdraws rent `Active/Complete` USDC transfer via CPI or vault unlock ✅ Final Verdict Area Status Notes Alignment to value prop ✅ Strong Directly reflects landlord-focused rent pain Scoping for MVP ⚠️ Moderate Could benefit from “core vs later” feature triage Granularity for Dev Work ⚠️ Weak Needs state machine definitions, data models, and role-based logic to move into implementation Admin/Compliance flows ❌ Lacking Needs clearer definition of actions, role gates, and edge case handling Next Steps to Strengthen Model Stream Lifecycle & State Transitions Define PDA data schemas for Solana List out role-based actions (Landlord, Tenant, Admin) Tag which flows are core PoC vs future phase Add timing rules (intervals, penalties, expirations) Let me know if you'd like help drafting these elements in Anchor syntax, defining schemas, or visualizing the stream lifecycle.  |
